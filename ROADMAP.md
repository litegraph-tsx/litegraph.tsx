# Roadmap

## Catch-up

- [*] Confirmed pnpm replaces npm successfully.  If the team agrees, we can remove package-lock.json

- [ ] Move editor/* somewhere better?  Open to suggestions!

- [ ] Move eslint.config.js into tooling and still have it work

- [ ] Implement PRs

- [ ] Correctly apply `reversion` commits from github.com/daniel-lewis-ab/litegraph.js without borking git history
