# Contribution Rules
There are some simple rules that everyone should follow:

1. Please leave `version control` and `publish` to Daniel Lewis.  It's not that I'm special, but we need to establish a consistent Semantic Versioning mechanism that can be trusted so that people can rely on our project.

2. Please do not alter `original` branch.  It is being kept as-is for reference.
